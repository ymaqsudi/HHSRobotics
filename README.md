This repo is built off of the FTC Skystone repo available publicly.

Most of the code written for our FTC Roboboogie team is in the mechanum branch (named after our drivetrain).

Our drivetrain code was able to drive forward, backwards, and strafe left and right. We did not have a 360 drivetrain this year.

Our intake mechanism was an overhead claw controlled by a servo and attached to a linear motion rack and pinion to extend the arm in the horizontal x direction. 

Our outtake mechanism was a linear lift controlled by bike chains to reduce friction and maintain a high speed during the transition from intake to outtake.
